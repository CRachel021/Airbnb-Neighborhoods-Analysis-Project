# Airbnb-Neighborhoods-Analysis-Project

`Descriptive Analysis` `Price Modelings` `Machine Leaning` `Visualization` 

### Background
Airbnb has seen a dramatic growth since its inception in 2008 with the number of rentals listed on its website 
growing exponentially each year. Airbnb has successfully disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more 
and more travelers, not just the ones who go for tourism but also business travelers who resort to Airbnb as their 
premier accommodation provider. 

Boston, capital of Massachusetts, economic center in east coast, is a livable and beautiful city with rich history, 
attracting millions of tourists all over the world. Would the combination of sharing economy and tourist city 
create something unusual? 

This project is going to dig deep into Boston Airbnb data and provide insightful suggestions to Airbnb 
host, customers and Airbnb. Things we did are included but not limit to data cleaning and transformation, 
descriptive analysis, daily price modelings (machine learning), results visualizations, review analytics (natural 
language processing).
